However the comparison of the oxidation product of haemopyrro·
line with the synthetically prepared imide shewed that they are
not identical — their melting points differ not inconsiderably (the
difference amounts to 7⁰ C). The authors named were not able
however to analyze the acid obtained from haemopyrroline and the
results, it may be hoped, are not absolutely binding.

In view of the great probability of the haemopyrroline formula
as given above, and having started synthetical experiments with
the view to prepare artificially haemopyrroline at the same time
as Kuster‚ and in any case independently from this author, we
have decide to test the said formula by a method ‘differing from
the one followed up by Kflster. Our idea was to reduce the imide
of methyl-n- propyl-maleic aeid and compare the ’product obtained
with haemopyrroline‚ formed by heremite.

The preparation of methyl-n-propyl-maleic anhydridc does
not offer any difficulties: propylacetoacetic ether is condensed with
prussic acid. the product obtained saponified and the methyl-propyl
malic acid produced distilled. The reaction takes place smoothly,
exactly in accordance with other similar synthesis described by
Michael and Tissot. The properties of the anhydride agree in
general with the description given by Kflster and Haas and
we may pass over at present any details, The imide we obtained by
prolonged heating of the anhydride with alcoholic ammonia to 110⁰.
Whereas Kaster and Haas describe crystalls of this substance
we never were so fortunate as to get it in the crystalline state.
The imide we tried to convert into haemopyrroline in exactly the
same *manner as Bell converted succinic imide into pyrroline‚
viz. we heated it with a large excess of zinc dust in the pre-
sence of hydrogen. There distilled very-soon a thick liquid which
possessed a smell similar to that of haemopyrmline, and which on
being treated with diluted hydroehloric aeid dissolved partly, leaving
a brown, greasy substance behind. The solution in dilute hydro-
chloric acid gave⁷ on being left over night in the presence of air,
a reddish brown precipitate5 which dissolved easily in alcohol with
a brownish red colour3 this solution showed an absorption spectrum
similar to that of urobilin and gave with ammoniacal zinc chloride
a fluorescent (greenish) liquor, showing a spectrum similar to that
of zinc urobilin. In other words, the reduction product of methyl-
n-propyl-maleic imide yields under the influence of oxygen of the
