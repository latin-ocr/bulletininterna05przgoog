Kfleter¹) gave a proof for the preexistence of a normal chain
which seemed to be unchallengable. This author has found that the
anhydride of the so called threebasic haematic aeid possesses the
formula:

οΗ,-ο;ο-οΗ,-οΗ,-οοοΗ

οόὲο

*os

on account of it being able to produce on eaddation succinic aeid
COOH . 0112 . CH, ‚GOOE The conversion of the anhydride of the
threebasic haematic acid into the anhydride of the bibaeic acid·
must therefore be formulated as follows:

on„-c= c- cH2.cH2.eooH ()[1;,,,--(];(3-(3ΗΞ,οΗ3

eo (io -› (io (¹20 -ff-oo²

the more so as the latter substance proved identical, according to
Mr. Galler²)‚ with the synthetically prepared methyl-ethyl·maleic
anhydride.

So far the facts agree exceedingly well with the assumption
that haemopyrroline is 3-metbyl-4-n-propyl-pyrroline.

The latest researches of Kaster and Haas ⁸) seem however
to call into question the above view. These authors prepared syn-
thetically‚ according to the well known method of Mich ael and
Tissot. methyl-propyl-maleic anhydride and then the correspon-
ding imide, and compared it with the oxidation product of haemo-
pyrroline. Based upon the results obtained by Plancher⁴) one
must expect that haemopyrroline, being 3·methyl-4-n-propyl-pyrro-
line will yield on oxidation the imide of methyl-propyl-maleic acid:
