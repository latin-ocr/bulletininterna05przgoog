air a colouring matter, showing properties very much aki'n to those
of urobilin1). thether these two colouring matters are really identi-
cal or not, we are at present unable to say3 the optical properties of
urobilin are not sufficiently characteristic for the purpose of identifi-
cation. We must therefore also defer any assumption concerning the
nature of the first reduction product of methyl·n-propyl-maleic imide.

Presuming that Kaster will follow up his former researohes,
we will not of course tresspass upon his field of researches, but we
shall endeavour to find out new means of identifying the reduction
produci: of methyl-n-propyl—maleic acid and study the behaviour
towards reducing agents of other homologues of maleic imide.

The chief reaction on which all the above experimenta are
based, the production of homologs of maleic aeid by the elegant
synthesis, discovered by Michael and Tissot, is cleared up in
all its details. The first stage leads to the formation of hydroxycya-
uides which on being saponified lead to homologs of hydroxysuc-
cinic acid. The latter containing one or tw0‚ as the case may be,
of asymmetrical carbon atoms must be liable to splitting up into
optical isomers. These views are completely in agreement with
facts, as we were able to ascertain. The combination product of
acetoacetic ether with hydrocyanic acid yields after being saponi-
fied a methyl-malic aeid:

01:13 . eo . οΗΞΒ . coo 0,Ηὸ -› οΗ3 . o (on) (Goon) . CH-2. . OOOH

which, containing only one asyxnmetrical carbon atom‚ must exist
in two optical isomeric modificatione. We succeeded in isolating one
of them, the dextro—rotatory antimer‚ in the pure crystalline state,
whereas the other, laevo rotatory‚ we could not up to the present
obtain in crystals⁸ The splitting up of the racemic acid takes place
easily by fractional crystallisation of its strychnine salt. The com-
bination of the dextro-antimer being less soluble crystallises first in
the form of fine white needleS‚ which are laevorotatory. By the
action of sodium hydrate this salt is decomposed in the usual way,
and the recovered aeid crystallised from acetic ether. Its melting

point is 1080—1090 and [affl = —l— 22830 (c = lb).
