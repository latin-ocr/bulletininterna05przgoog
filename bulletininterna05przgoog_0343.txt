substances is indeed highly probable. At present I am in the posi-
tion to prove it absolutely.

The difficulties of preparation of pure cholehaematim appeared
to me under the conditions of my laboratory unsurmountable but
they have been. as it proved5 overcome elswhere In a highly in-
teresting paper read before the Academy of Sciences of Vienna.
Loebisch and Fischler ¹) described a substance, isolated from the
bile of herbivora under the name of bilipurpurin (The quantity
of bile used amounted to 100 litresll. Although the description of
this substance as given by these authors does not agree in all
particulars with that of my phylloerythrine‚ the similarity of the
properties of both substances appeared sufficiently great to awaken
the wish to compare both substances by· direct observation. Prof.
Loebisch was kind enough to send me by my request a minute
but quite sufficient quantity of bilipurpurin, and a eareful compa-
rison of its optical properties with those shown by phylloerythrin
and by cholehaematin proved conclusively that all these substances
are indeed identical.

The crystals of bilipurpurin are quite identical with those of
phylloerythrin. The preparation sent to me by Mr. Loebisch con-
tained not only crystals escribed by him and closer investigated
by Cathrein. but also rhombic plates with blunted corners which
Ihave found to be characteristic of phylloerythrine. On the other
hand some of my new preparations of phylloerythrine contain elon-
gated plateS, similar to those depicted by Loebisch.

The optical properties of bilipurpurin and phylloerythrine are
absolutely identical. In my former communication ²) I mentioned
that concentrated solutions of phylloerytrine in acetic acid cause.
a spectrum with four hands, one of which, near the G-line‚ is
extremely faint. A direct comparison of such solution with a bili-
purpurin solution showed that, given equal concentrations‚ the hands
in both cases are placed in exactly the same position3 in fact it
is impossible to distinguish one spectrum from the other. More
dilute solutions do not show the faint band in the orange. The
colour of both substances is of course identical3 cherry red is,
may be. the most suitable description for it. Both solutions show
