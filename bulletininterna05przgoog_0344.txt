also dichroizm3 in reflected light thin layers appear greenish. Hy·
drochloric aeid added to the above solutions causes an identical
change in both cases. The colour turns bluish violet and the solu-
tions, if sufficiently diluted cause four bands in positions which
differ considerably from those occupied by the original hands. In
the orange there are now two narrow faint hands, past the D line
a broad dark band and finally in the green a badly defined faint
band. The wave lengths corresponding to these hands I have
given before 1).

The chloroformic solutions of phylloerythrine and bilipurpurin
show also exactly the same spectrum. The band in the orange is in
this case more pronounced than in the acetic acid solution. Loebisch
and Fischler²) did not mention it3 they examined evidently com-
paratively dilute solutions. Bilipurpurin‚ like phylloerythrine, enters
into reactions with zinc acetate and cuprio acetate3 the salts formed
cause identical absorptions. Alcoholic potash dissolves both sub-
stances easily. yiclding brownish-red-violet solutions,

The final proof of the identitJ⁹ of phylloerythrine and bilipur-
purin is given by the examination of the absorption bands in the
ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Phylloerythrine causes9 as I have
shown ³), two very characteristic hands. a darker one in front of
the kss-line and a faint one just past this line. Bilipurpurin behaves
in exiictly the same manner. Photographs taken on the same plate
of both colouring matters dissolved in chloroform or in acetic aeid
show that the bands are in absolutely identical positions.

As regards the identity of bilipurpurin and ch‹›lehaematin there
cannot be any doubt. Loebisch and Fischler were not acquainted
with the papers of Mac Munn and Gamgee on chulehaematin and
this was the cause of introduction of a new name for an already
known substance. The great merit of Loebisch's researches is how-
ever by no means impared by this fact.

We have therefore at present three different names for the same
substance3 which of them will be suffered to survive depends upon
further researches. These must definitely settle the origin of the
colouring matter with absorption bandS‚ met with in biles of her-
